                                                                    Channel Subscription
As a cable TV operator, I want to provide my customers the ability to subscribe to a channel of their choice and upgrade to different packs based on their preference. 
A customer has a certain balance in his/her account and wishes to subscribe to a channel. The channel should get added to the list of subscribed channels for the customer.
A customer might also wish to upgrade an existing channel he/she has already subscribed to. This should be allowed if an upgrade is possible for the channel. All of the
above should be allowed as long as the customer has the required minimum balance needed for subscription/upgrade. After the subscription/upgrade the difference amount 
should be reflected immediately in the customerâ€™s account.
