      You have been hired as a software consultant at a chemist. The chemist shop sells various types of
compounds and mixture to their customers. They have a research team that put together various formulas
for the chemist of sell. The owner of the shop is a bit of stickler for cleanliness and is also afraid of
unforeseen reactions when creating the compounds. So,she has created a rule where a new mixing can is to
used for creating a new compound (whether the compound is made of the base elements or from another
set of pre-made compounds). Your job as a consultant is to determine the minimal number of bowls that
are required to make them. Any compound/element that is part of a definition, without its own definition
can be assumed to be a base element. base elements donâ€™t need any preparation.

Multiline input. Where first line N specifies the number of compound definitions followed by N definitions.
Followed. Followed by integer M specifies the number of compounds to prepare and M compounds
to prepare.

Calculate the minimum number of bowls required to prepared the given compounds.
